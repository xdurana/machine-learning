Abu-Mostafa](https://work.caltech.edu/)\r\n\r\nThis is an introductory course in machine learning (ML) that covers the basic theory, algorithms, and applications. ML is a key technology in Big Data, and in many financial, medical, commercial, and scientific applications. It enables computational systems to adaptively improve their performance with experience accumulated from the observed data. ML has become one of the hottest fields of study today, taken up by undergraduate and graduate students from 15 different majors at Caltech. This course balances theory and practice, and covers the mathematical as well as the heuristic aspects.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## [Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets)\r\n### University of Toronto\r\nProf. [Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/)\r\n\r\nLearn about artificial neural networks and how they're being used for machine learning, as applied to speech and object recognition, image segmentation, modeling language and human motion, etc. We'll emphasize both the basic algorithms and the practical tricks needed to get them to work well.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)\r\n### Stanford University\r\nProf. [Fei-Fei Li](http://vision.stanford.edu/index.html)\r\n\r\nComputer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. The final assignment will involve training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). We will focus on teaching how to set up the problem of image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g. backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning the networks and guide the students through hands-on assignments and a final course project. Much of the background and materials of this course will be drawn from the ImageNet Challenge.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## [Machine Learning](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/)\r\n### University of Oxford\r\nProf. [Nando de Freitas](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/)\r\n\r\nMachine learning techniques enable us to automatically extract features from data so as to solve predictive tasks, such as speech recognition, object recognition, machine translation, question-answering, anomaly detection, medical diagnosis and prognosis, automatic algorithm configuration, personalisation, robot control, time series forecasting, and much more. Learning systems adapt so that they can solve new tasks, related to previously encountered tasks, more efficiently.\r\n\r\nThe course focuses on the exciting field of deep learning. By drawing inspiration from neuroscience and statistics, it introduces the basic background on neural networks, back propagation, Boltzmann machines, autoencoders, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. It illustrates how deep learning is impacting our understanding of intelligence and contributing to the practical design of intelligent machines.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
